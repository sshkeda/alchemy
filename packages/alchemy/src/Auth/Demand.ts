/**
 * The credential-demand seam for credential-free `alchemy dev`.
 *
 * A dev run whose plan is entirely local must never touch (or prompt for)
 * cloud credentials. When the plan DOES need the cloud — a resource opted
 * out of local emulation via `Alchemy.remote()`, a local Worker binding
 * that proxies to a remote resource (`dev: { remote: true }`), or the
 * deletion of a row that was last reconciled live — credentials are
 * validated exactly once, up front, BEFORE apply begins. The seam never
 * starts a login flow: missing credentials fail with the typed
 * {@link CredentialsRequired} error naming the demanding resources and
 * pointing at `alchemy profile edit` — the profile command is the only
 * place logins happen.
 *
 * The RPC sidecar only ever reads credentials persisted by a prior
 * `alchemy profile edit`.
 *
 * Non-dev runs (`alchemy deploy` / `destroy`) never enter this seam:
 * state-store init and live providers drive the pre-existing lazy
 * credential-resolution flow unchanged.
